# kiva_project-Jupyter-
This is a guided project imported from Jupyter Notebooks

Using a dataset from kaggle we can visualize insights. the dataset contains information about loans awarded by the non-profit Kiva (https://www.kiva.org/pgtmp/home).

Using Seaborn, we can explore the average loan amount by country using aggregated bar charts. We will also visualize the distribution of loan amounts by project type and gender using box plots and violin plots.
